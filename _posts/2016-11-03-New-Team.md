A new year is coming up on us, and there's a new CSIT team to meet it.

## New Team
-----

Last week the club held its Annual General Meeting (AGM), marking roughly one year since I joined the club as its 'Events Manager'. Of the six students that served with last year, [Candice](https://www.linkedin.com/in/candicebowditch), [Julian](https://au.linkedin.com/in/julian-wise-3a842738) and myself ([Jono](https://au.linkedin.com/in/jonathonbelotti)) will carry on fighting towards a vision of CSIT Society as a engine of technical and professional development at RMIT. We thank outgoing members Keaton, Jack, and Paul for their service and participation. My experiences within the team and at university generally have profited greatly from having been in this with you. But on to the future.

We welcome [Jacqueline](https://au.linkedin.com/in/jacshad), Renee, Erwin, [Michael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-swiatkiwsky-167915126), and Kieran. Six have become eight, and with that a greater capacity to push forward in our ambitions. The goals of this new team will be identical to that of the previous, but it's functioning will be quite different. Learning from the experiences of last year, the 'P' and 'VP' will be leading an agile (eugh buzzword), result-oriented, and accountable team. We have great projects in the works, and they demand a dedicated, productive group of students. In tackling these things, we hope that the team will itself learn a hell of a lot about project development and leadership, whilst ending up with outcomes that provide a lot of added benefit to students.

I better stop writing about it and go make it happen. Thanks for reading.
