It's been over a year since this site was updated, and I'm delighted to announce our executive for the year 2019.

### Executive Roles

* President - Avrami Hammer
* Vice President - Tom Franz
* Events Manager - Alex Jarvis
* Treasurer - Susanna Huang
* Secretary - Eddy Berberovic

You may notice an extra role in the executive team since last year, the new Events Manager role was added to our
constitution last AGM to help with the massive uptick in activity we saw over last year and hope to continue into this year.
