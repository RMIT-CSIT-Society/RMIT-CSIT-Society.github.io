title: Getting a Software Internship as a Melbourne Student

At RMIT, getting a paid internship is essential for Software Engineering undergraduates, and highly valuable to Computer Science undergraduates. At the CSIT Society, we think often about how students can secure internship opportunities. The following includes a general overview of the internship landscape and is a brief covering of the behaviours and attitudes we at CSIT think are important for students seeking internships, including perspectives from RMIT students who have themselves already secured positions.

### What’s out there

Software, as they say, is taking over the world. Unfortunately though for Melbourne students, the vast majority of that software is being written elsewhere. All the companies you know: Google, Apple, Uber, Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Oracle, etc. Very few of them maintain engineering teams in Australia, and even less provide internship opportunities to undergraduates.

When it comes time to find an internship for 3rd year students, RMIT students can expect to encounter only a few companies at recruiting sessions on campus, and that only a dozen or so software companies participate in internship events. Of the students we contacted for comment, the majority of them applied to only one company. There’s certainly more out there than what would be suggested by RMIT’s events and communications, but you’ll have to take the initiative and do your own research.

The best way to seek these opportunities is to persistently google search things like: “Melbourne internships at X”, “X Australian internships 2017”, and to look on Meetup.com for companies in Melbourne that host meet up groups (99 Designs, Zendesk, Envato). Companies hosting meet ups are often receptive to student interns, and showing up to a meet up is a good signal to send.

The following is a list of high quality ’target' companies around Melbourne and Sydney known to provide internships to undergraduate students. They are listed in ascending order based on the difficulty of getting accepted. The last on the list are *extremely* hard to get into.

`[Leidos, Xero, IMC, Zendesk, Culture Amp, Envato, 99-Designs, Atlassian, Optiver, Palantir, Amazon, Google]`

### Hurdles to getting an offer

Do you need a high GPA, personal coding projects, hackathon success, volunteering experience? Should I practice coding on a whiteboard for interviews? As you’d expect, it varies from place to place. There are internship placements that can be gained with very minimal technical questioning  (Leidos is like this), places that *will* test at least basic coding skills and technical knowledge (Zendesk is like this), and places that rigorously test internship applicants with difficult technical problems that would confound many professionals.

The absence of technical testing in interviews *does not* mean the internship itself will be lacking in development of technical skills. It may be the case, but often the employer is simply more interested in your GPA (> 3 is good) and eagerness to learn. To stand out in these interview processes, it’s your communication ability and your attitudes towards your education and career that should really shine through.

For those internships that ‘test the basics’, expect to be presented with Leetcode Easy problems during a phone/whiteboard interview, and answer questions that should be easy *if you paid attention in class*. Communication and attitude are of course still important here, but they won’t matter if you can’t pass the technical.

As for those places with rigorous technical testing, you *can* get internships at some of these places, but you will have to have a very impressive resumé to even get an interview, and from there your technical ability will be rigorously tested. If you are winning national programming competitions, publishing papers, or just generally killing the game, these top-tier companies will be interested. That being said, you should absolutely still apply as the practice will be invaluable, and there is nothing to lose by giving it your best shot. For all you know, you could be exactly who they’re looking for, so aim high and apply!

So there is a clear division in application processes between different groups of companies. Thus, your choice of companies to target will influence how you prioritise your preparation..

### What’s the most important thing?

We asked a number students in internships currently to say what they thought was most important to them securing their position. There were a number of point that came up more than once, which are listed below:

* "Apply for internships *early* and make it a priority”
* "prioritise the assignment and practical components of your courses and degrees.”
* "Communication and being able to talk to others is key, try not to go through your degree in complete isolation.”

There was an overall sense from the respondents that one has to be enterprising and self-sufficient. Talk to other students and find out what they’re doing to secure internships during their course. Maybe they’re doing nothing, and will be glad to realise that they should. Maybe they’re doing loads of things, and you’ll be able to collaborate with them. Actually take your studies seriously, because you’re at university largely to prepare for professional practice. When ‘internship season’ comes around (it’s earlier than you think, in June), have your resumé up-to-date and send it to more than one place. There’s no single most important thing one can do to get, it’s a combinations of behaviours that by those students who are forward-looking and engaged.
