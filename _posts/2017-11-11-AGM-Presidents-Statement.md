Hey, I’m Jonathon Belotti, third-year Software Engineering student and current President of the CSIT Society. The following statement serves as the “written report” made requisite in the club’s constitution. I will go over what were my own personal goals in my role, whether I have achieved those goals, and what I recommend for the role of president and the club generally going forward.

My Goals
-----------------------

Coming on as president my general goal was to increase the ‘output’ of the CSIT Society in terms of events and educative media. My specific goal was to strongly increase the level of management and oversight that would be experienced by the rest of the committee. I saw the president’s role as primarily one of delegation, scheduling, project design and estimation.

I had the general goal because as a club CSIT Society had previously done a lot of ‘talking the talk’ and not much ‘walking the walk’. I felt that if we were at least finishing club projects, actually holding events, then we were making certain progress.

I had the specific, more personnel focused goal, because in my understanding it was a lack of ‘follow-up’ and accountability that led to the low output of the club. In previous years with the club, holding conversations and then hoping that committee members would take initiative and self-sufficiently complete things led to not much happening.

Finally, I’d also mention that I felt it was important for the president to maintain a good relationship with the committee generally, supporting them and being basically a good team member.

The Outcomes
----------------------

I’ll start with the good. The CSIT Society’s overall output to its members has significantly increased compared with 2015 and 2016. Two social events were held, Atlassian was hosted, a Git workshop was held. I won't detail everything the was delivered, but just say that overall I was happy with the improvements.

As to the personnel focused goal, I'd mark that down as not achieved, or maybe only half acheived. I expected going in that man management would be a time-intensive task, and that it would compromise my ability to complete work myself. This turned out to be the case, and I regularly found that I could only perform management duties in bursts, rather than making a sustained efforts. Taking into account the commitments of my internship, Programming Club, self-learning, and regular interviewing, there was never enough time to do CSIT. While I certainly was touching base with the executive committee and working towards outcomes, there would be periods longer than a month where no communication happened on my end.

Recommendations Going Forward
--------------------------------

Key recommendations for the club are largely the same as those I made a year previous. Definitely focus on output, on end-product. Don't get stuck in long discussions that see no follow through; don't get complacent.

Personnel management from the president and vice-president remains important. The CSIT Society committee has to have real accountability as a team, and that starts at the top. If the president isn't accountable, who is?

Break down work into small sprint deliverables. Small size long-term projects lack urgency, and get forgotten. Large size long-term projects are daunting, and hard to track. A blog post on the CSIT website is I think a good example of something that, given the right content, is aligned with club aims and is small enough for a single committee member to deliver over a day or two.

If you're on the committee, go to meetups. It's a great way to engage with industry and open the club up to opportunities that can benefit members.
