RMIT Programming Club was re-founded in July 2016 to ensure that RMIT students in the city would have a place to learn and enjoy programming together.

The club is in its infancy and thus its direction is still being determined by the interests of early members. Broadly the club hopes to continue in the tradition of most programming clubs and focus on learning, collaborative projects, and programming competitions.

Weekly meetings are starting up, and the details of those meetings are available on this site, so that you may better understand what we're about.

If you would like to join the club, or otherwise become involved, please don't hesitate to email.
