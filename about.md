The RMIT CSIT Society is a RUSU affiliated group that aims to represent and serve the students in Software Engineering, Computer Science, and associated Information Technology Programs. The group is committed to engaging students in events and activities that further both their professional and technical development.

In addition to this, the group aims to facilitate social interactions between its own members and members of other student organisations and groups, as well as providing students with opportunities to connect with industry and potential employers in the form of technical workshops, hackathons, and regular meet-ups before major tech events.

If you would like to join the club, or otherwise become involved, please don't hesitate to email.
